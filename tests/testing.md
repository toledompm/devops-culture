# Software Testing

Software testing is a method to check whether the actual software matches the expected requirements and to ensure that the software is defect free. It involves the execution of software components using manual or automated tools to ensure the quality and requirements.

## Importance

Software testing is important because if there are any bugs, errors or missing requirements in the software, then it can be identified early and can be solved before delivery the software to the customer.

## Software tests benefits

Properly tested software ensures reliability, security and product quality which further results in time saving, costs effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

## Types of software testing

### Functional testing

Function testing validates the software system against the functional requirements/specifications. The puporse of functional tests is to test each function/component/module of the software application, by providing appropriate input and verify that the output is equal to the expected output requirement.

The functional testing test:

- Mainline functions: testing separated functions checking whether the execution returns the expected output
- Error conditions: testing corner cases and their treatments
- Basic usability and accessibility: It involes basic usability testing checking whether the user can freely navigate through the application without any difficulties

Some steps of functional testing are:

- Understand the functional requirements
- Identify test input or test data based on requirements
- Compute the expected outcomes with selected test input values
- Execute test cases
- Compare actual and computed expected results

Some examples of functional testing are:

- Unit testing
- Integration testing

### Unit testing

Is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate each unit of the software code performs as expected, isolating code sections and verifying their correctness. Unit testing is done during the development/coding phase of an application by the developers or QA engineers, when there are time concern or relutance of developers to test.

### Non-function testing or performance testing
