### What is application monitoring?
Application monitoring is the process that ensures that software systems and networks maintain the levels of performance necessary to support business results.
This process is used by DevOps professionals to measure and evaluate the performance of the elements of the software application (from the application to the infrastructure) and as the primary means for detecting, screening and correcting performance problems. As application complexity increases, tools in this category also employ analysis to reduce false alarms, locate anomalies and predict problems.

### Benefits?
Most IT departments spend more time reacting to problems than trying to identify them before they cause disruption. However, for them to function at optimal performance and avoid errors, proactive application monitoring is essential.
- Early detection of problems
- Performance monitoring
- Prevention of network interruptions
- Identify security threats

### Metrics?
Metrics are a crucial aspect of the application monitoring system. It is important to track various components of your system and have several different perspectives if you want to be able to pinpoint the root cause of delays accurately and quickly.
This requires automated visibility, made possible by a comprehensive application monitoring software program. Although it is not a complete list, you should consider the following aspects for effective application monitoring.
