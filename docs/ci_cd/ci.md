# Continuous integration (CI)

With continuous integration (CI), developers consolidate code changes back to a shared branch more often. The changes are consolidated and then validated through the automatic creation of the application. Various automated tests, usually unit and integration tests, are done to ensure that changes do not corrupt the application. Basically, everything is tested, including classes, functions and different modules that make up the entire application.

In case of conflict between new and existing codes, a CI facilitates the correction of these bugs quickly and frequently.

## Benefits

In the past, developers on a team can work in isolation for a long time and only add their changes to the main branch when they have completed their work. Thus, merging code changes was difficult and time-consuming, as well as resulting in the accumulation of errors without correction for long periods. These factors made it difficult to distribute quick updates to customers.

### How does continuous integration work?

A seamless integration service that automatically creates and runs unit tests on new code changes to immediately spot all errors. Among many other actions that he can perform.
