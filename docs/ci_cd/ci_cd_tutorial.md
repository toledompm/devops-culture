After writing the file you can save the changes to the green button in the top corner <em>“Start Commit”</em>

You can see an example of [CI here](https://github.com/toledompm/devops-app/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml).

You can consult an example [CD here](https://github.com/toledompm/devops-app/blob/main/.github/workflows/aws.yml).
