# Cloud Infrastructure

Cloud infrastructure covers everything needed to host services and applications in the cloud. This ranges from hardware, storage, abstracted resources and more. These components are integrated into one another, forming a single architecture.

## Components

### Hardware

Cloud hardware ranges from physical servers to networking equipment. They can be spread across multiple geographical locations. It's brought together by internal and external networks, and redistributed by virtualization.

### Virtualization

Virtualization in way is what allows cloud services to exist. A piece of software called a hypervisor, sits on top of the hardware layer, abstracting its resources. These virtual resources are then pooled together, and made available for on-demand comsumption.

### Storage

In large datacenters, storage may be spread over many physical disks. All while ensuring redunduncy in cases of hardware failure, as well as indexing for fast and reliable retrieval. Storage is one of the main components of Cloud Infrastructure, making something such as storage scaling, usually hard and time consuming, into something easy and manageable.

### Network

Networks are built, both physically and virtually. Physical networks bring resources together, while virtual networks (built on top of these physical links) bring security and privacy, into an otherwise public space.
